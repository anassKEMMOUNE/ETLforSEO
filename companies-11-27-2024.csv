In the 1850’s advancements in refrigeration and food preservation dramatically lowered food prices and increased availability. In the 1940’s innovation came in the form of gasoline tractors replacing horse drawn plows. Today, blockchain technology is poised to play a major part in the agricultural revolution of our time.  GrainChain’s patent pending solution utilizes blockchain technology to address numerous issues present within the soft commodities markets, such as fraud at all stages, large and small-scale corruption, payment delays, access to futures commodities market, and a cycle of debt that is difficult to escape.

GrainChain utilizes the well-known properties of blockchains to address the systemic problems present in soft commodities markets, an industry in which the GrainChain team already has first hand experience in building software solutions.  The GrainChain system greatly increases transparency and accountability within the agriculture business by eliminating disparate and wasteful paper trails, greatly eliminating the opportunity for fraud and dramatically reducing time and costs. It ensures the prompt and secure execution of contracts between farmers and buyers, by both automatically facilitating payment to the farmer and making available the corresponding financial instrument for trading on commodities markets while verifying it is backed by only real assets in the system.

Transparent Path spc,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/transparent-path,,1-10,Seed,812023,USD,812023,"SEED-STAGE • LOGISTICS TECH • FOR-PROFIT • SOCIAL PURPOSE CORPORATION. For buyers and sellers of perishable goods, Transparent Path creates real-time, end-to-end supply chain visibility technologies that reduce waste, cost, and risk.  WHO WE ARE: Former senior executives from the food, tech, and social impact sectors, from companies like Amazon, IBM, Xerox, Microsoft, Target, and General Mills. We came together in 2020 to use the skills we honed over long careers to create meaningful positive impacts. Our social mission: to keep food, medicines and other critical perishables out of landfills.  Founded as an LLC in 2018. Restructured and launched as a social purpose corp (C-corp) in 2020.  PROBLEM Supply chain data technologies have been underfunded for generations — still largely powered by paper, faxes and disconnected systems. These antiquated approaches were incapable of handling the enormous systemic strains caused by pandemic-related labor and equipment shortages, disruptions, and growing, complex regulation. Paper systems mean shippers and receivers can't manage what they can't see. So we decided to combine a number of advanced technologies and new approaches for today's challenges, including AI, IoT, 5G, printed electronics, and machine vision. SOLUTIONS We bring both software and hardware solutions to the market to reduce cost, waste, and risk in perishable supply chains.  -- PRODUCT 1: The Transparent Path Visibility Platform (PaaS). Customers affix our continuously-connected cellular sensors to pallets entering the supply chain. These sensors constantly capture and report the location, temperature, humidity, and other factors for these shipments into our visibility cloud. This platform was built with collaboration in mind. Supply chain partners are grouped in Consortiums — dynamic partnerships based around common trade relationships. Product customers are tracked, easing data sharing and showing who's ""got the ball.""  When location or conditions jeopardize our customers' products, we send out real-time alerts to the appropriate parties who can intervene and save the shipment, along with its freshness, safety, and financial value.  -- PRODUCT 2: FreshScore™ - our patented predictive freshness algorithm targeted at buyers. FreshScore uses both production data and supply chain environmental data to predict the freshness of perishables before they arrive at retail. This unique algorithm arms food producers with quality control data, allowing for the routing of the best product to the best customers, minimizing surprises and rejections. It also helps reduce waste by anticipating freshness and viability issues before they occur. We are partnering with ReFED, the top food waste non-profit, to bring this technology to market. -- PRODUCT 3: ProofScore™ - our ""credit score for transparency."" ProofScore is a patented algorithm that scores perishable producers and products based on data transparency. The more data shared with supply chain partners and consumers, the higher the ProofScore.  ProofScore puts information into the hands of consumers, answering the question, where did this product come from? How did it get to me? What happened to it along the way? ProofScore-ranked products can command higher margins and grow stronger customer satisfaction. We are partnering with a large Japanese multinational firm on its development.  -- PRODUCT 4: ProofTracker - our eco-friendly sensor device. This advanced temperature/humidity/shock tracker is a cellular gateway built on biodegradable materials.    BENEFITS Our products reduce customers' supply chain losses, retailer rejections, insurance premiums, wasted time, and labor costs spent on reconciliations. They also reduce negative impacts to natural capital, including keeping food and perishables out of landfills.

Outfield is a precision orchard management system that provides growers with fruit counts and year round variability maps. By providing key insights on orchard performance, we help growers become more efficient, more profitable, and more environmentally friendly.  Yield estimates are crucial for all aspects of fruit growing, from maximising orchard production to agreeing sales contracts. Growers estimate yields manually based on around 0.5% of their trees. The unreliable and limited data they collect leads to 20% average errors in estimated yield per orchard. This reduces output, efficiency and profit while increasing environmental damage. Outfield growers have less than 10% error in their yield estimates. Our growers use inexpensive off-the-shelf drones, loaded with flight plans from Outfield. At the touch of a button, they make a 30-minute automated drone flight covering thousands of trees. The images are sent to Outfield’s cloud based platform and processed using bespoke image recognition algorithms. Maps and insights are returned to growers within 24hrs. This strategy allows Outfield to deploy a scalable SAAS model. Our fruit-level data platform has been developed and trialled with apple and pear growers on 3 continents, and our MVP is being used right now by paying beta-test growers in the UK, New Zealand, and South Africa. Growers have praised the unparalleled flexibility, speed and ease of drone data acquisition. We are now looking for investment to drive our growth and to scale our product to meet the growing demand. Our team is ready to build and expand international presence, to broaden our service offering with new product features, and to move into new market segments in other fruit crops.

Shipshape Urban Farms,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/shipshape-urban-farms,,11-50,Convertible Note,350000,USD,350000,"At Shipshape Urban Farms, we envision a future where sustainable agriculture converges seamlessly with urban landscapes, transforming the way we grow, consume, and think about food. As the CEO of Shipshape Urban Farms, I am committed to leading our company on a path of innovation and growth that reshapes the sustainable farming landscape. In 2023, we are driven by our focus on container gardens, fostering sales and introducing our concept to individuals, families, and businesses alike. The construction of three modular container gardens serves as our hallmark in Birmingham, Alabama, where innovation meets reality, generating a substantial $45K per month in revenue. This landmark achievement is only the beginning. We are excited to pilot partnerships with esteemed grocery store chains, nearby restaurants, and bustling farmers markets, cementing our place as pioneers in sustainable agriculture. Looking ahead to 2024, we will embark on a journey of growth and investment. Our aim is to raise $10 million, propelling us toward the creation of our first HAB in Huntsville, Alabama, a 3D-printed marvel. Simultaneously, we will expand our contracts with grocery stores, working tirelessly to secure our position as a leading supplier of fresh, locally grown produce. The path to our goal is paved with essential milestones: completing carbon capture testing with the National Carbon Center, forging impactful collaborations with NASA, signing contracts for five new Container Gardens, and realizing the completion of our Birmingham Farm. Partnerships for the construction of our HABs are instrumental in our progress, amplifying our vision and reach. With our sights set on 2025, we plan to raise a combination of VC and/or bank loans $200 million to construct 20 new HABs across the United States and strategic locations worldwide. Our partnerships with grocery stores flourish, and we will expand our impact and influence on the food industry. We anticipate the launch of our inaugural project with NASA and Above Space, a testament to our prowess in innovation and cutting-edge technology. By signing contracts for 45 new Container Gardens, we will make a resounding statement about the future of sustainable agriculture. After celebrating a full year of operation for our Huntsville HAB, our vision will extend to new revenue streams, including the sale of HABs to third parties, carbon capture endeavors, and a promising collaboration with NASA in the realm of space. By 2026, our focus shifts toward operating with precision and excellence, optimizing every facet of our endeavors. This sets the stage for 2027, when we embark on the next phase of our journey: the pursuit of an exit strategy that honors our mission, our investors, and our relentless pursuit of redefining urban farming. Together, with a dedicated team and steadfast commitment to sustainability and innovation, we at Shipshape Urban Farms are on a mission to cultivate a greener, more nourished future for all. Our container gardens, HABs, and pioneering partnerships are but the beginning of a groundbreaking era in sustainable agriculture.

Drought and increasing water scarcity is quickly felt in metropolitan areas. Thankfully, efforts can be taken to better manage irrigation of public green-spaces, preemptively preventing over irrigation and water waste. Our goal is to support growers and landscapers get the most ‘value per drop’ while eliminating wasteful watering. The sensors enable growers to achieve a reduction of water use of up to 30%.","Amsterdam, Noord-Holland, The Netherlands","Sensoterra's wireless, IoT, low cost soil moisture probes help farmers effectively irrigate crops, save water, cut costs & increase yields","77,440",,,,,$1M to $10M,2015-03-01,day,Active,,,,,For Profit,https://www.sensoterra.com,https://www.linkedin.com/company/sensoterra/,"Eduard Zanen, Erik Damen, Jurriaan Ruys, Mark Ruys",4,2,3000000,EUR,3293109,"Future Food Fund, ROM Utrecht Region",,2,"Agriculture, AgTech, Hardware, Internet of Things, Landscaping, Smart Cities, Wireless"

Climate change and environmental degradation are the largest existential threats to humanity in the 21st century, and also the largest economic opportunity of our time. These problems are fundamentally issues of economic coordination. Regen Network, a Techstars-backed company, is a digital platform powered by Cosmos SDK that allows farmers, brands, and institutions to make auditable ecological agreements so that we can rapidly accelerate the adoption of regenerative agriculture and reverse global climate change. Regen Network is comprised of two important parts. We are building a Proof-of-Stake blockchain focused on ecological data, assets, and agreements using the Tendermint Consensus Engine and the Cosmos SDK. Join us to help secure what we believe will be the most important distributed ledger on Earth — the ledger of ecological health and agreements. In addition to creating the underlying infrastructure necessary for ecological accounting, we’re also building real-world applications. Investing in Regen Network Now is the time to take bold action to reverse the degradation of this planet. This technology offers us an incredible opportunity to do just that. We are currently in a private pre-sale for our native staking token or offering convertible notes for equity if that is what you prefer. We will personally guide you through the investment process to make it as easy, private, and secure as possible. Token Mechanics Regen Ledger is secured through our staking token, the Regen token (XRN). XRN follows the Cosmos Proof-of-Stake consensus and token economics. By purchasing and staking XRN, you help secure this essential infrastructure and the public good it generates, plus staked tokens receive network fees and block rewards as compensation for this important work. For more detailed information please see our economics paper. Regen Network Development, Inc. is building a contracting platform utilizing Regen Ledger to make easy and accessible ecological contracts between institutions and land managers, who may not have the capacity to interact directly with the blockchain. At the center of these agreements are scientifically-robust ecological protocols that verify a change in practice or outcomes on the ground.

N2 Applied has developed a technology that enables local production of fertilizer from liquid organic substrates such as slurry or digestate with air and electricity. The technology adds nitrogen from the air into the liquid substrate and increases the nitrogen content. The reaction stops the loss of ammonia and reduces emissions, making it an efficient and sustainable fertilizer, and creating a more circular farm system. N2’s scalable process enables fertilizer production to be re-distributed to the end-user, the farmer – cutting long and expensive value chains, and reducing the need for chemical fertilizer production based on fossil gas or coal.
